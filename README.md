# E-Commerce

This is an ecommerce project that I started to help new programmers and myself in better understanding the entire cycle required for developing an e-commerce website. 
The text that we read in books during our grad is not sufficient and I find that organisations do not get the tallent they are looking forward to in a candidate.

The codes in the source contains comments too so anyone forking this project could understand what is going on and how certain things are accomplished.

However, if you face any difficulty or you are not able to understand any part then please feel free to start a conversation.

## It has the following features:
* Shopping cart
* Adding items to cart
* Removing items from cart
* Purchase feature using paypal's API
* Bootstrap usage (with comments)

#### However, please still consider this as a work in progress (WIP) I will keep on adding more features to it.
